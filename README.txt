- all main files are in thesis-main, where thesis.tex is the root file
- \import and \subimport are used instead of \include or \input. \import{path}{file}, where path can be absolute or from the top directory and file can be with or without the '.tex'. \subimport{subpath}{file}, where subpath is ammended to path, i.e. /path/subpath/ and file can be with or without the '.tex'.
- the main tex file is thesis.tex
- within thesis.tex, the chapters are imported
- each chapter has its own directory, within which a tex file of the same name can be found. This is the main tex file for this chapter
- within each chapter tex file, subimport is used to import each section and subsection where neccessary
- global_settings.tex contains all the packages and formatting
- don't use absolute paths so it is not machine dependent
- use pngquant to compress png images. make directory uncompressed-png/ in /images/. mv png images there. run '$pngquant *.png'. then '$mv *fs8* ../'. Then 'rename 's/-fs8//' *.png'.
